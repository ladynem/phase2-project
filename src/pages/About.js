      <p>👋🏼 As an educator, I know that ensuring student safety and accountability is paramount and, even when students are using the restroom or visiting the nurse, teachers are still responsible for their activity and wellbeing. However, traditional methods of tracking students' out-of-class time activities, such as paper sign-in/out sheets, are prone to errors, inefficiencies, and lack real-time data accessibility. To solve this problem, I created HallWize, a digital student activity tracker that offers a modern solution to the challenges associated with tracking student out-of-class time activities. By leveraging technology to provide real-time tracking and accurate record-keeping, this app enhances safety, accountability, and efficiency for all stakeholders. I believe that implementing this app will lead to a safer, more transparent, and more productive learning environment for educators, students, and parents alike.</p>

      <p>The app will provide real-time tracking of student movements, allowing teachers and administration to instantly know which students are outside the classroom and for what reasons (restroom breaks, nurse visits, etc.). This ensures timely responses to any incidents or emergencies.</p>

      <strong>📈 Accurate Record-Keeping</strong>
      <p>Unlike paper sign-in sheets, which can be easily misplaced or falsified, the digital app will maintain accurate and detailed records of student activities.

      <p>Parents will receive instant notifications when their child leaves the classroom, providing peace of mind and transparency regarding their child's whereabouts during school hours. This promotes parental involvement and facilitates communication between parents and school staff.</p>

      <p>The app will streamline administrative tasks by generating automated reports on student attendance and activity patterns. This data can be used to identify trends, address behavioral issues, and make informed decisions regarding campus safety and resource allocation.</p>
      
      <strong>🌟 Customizable Settings</strong>
      <p>The app will offer customizable settings to accommodate the unique needs and policies of each school. This includes configurable permissions for teachers, administrators, and parents, as well as options to set alerts for specific events or scenarios.</p>
